Geography,Latitude_Vs,Obs1,Obs2
Global,Max Temperature,Temperature south of the equator is not correlated with latitude.,Temperature is more extreme once latitude increases above 0 degrees.
Global,Humidity,Humidity and latitude have low correlation,"In general, more locations have above 60% humidity"
Global,Cloudiness,Cloudiness distribution may be bi-modal given disparity of plot concentration as cloudiness approaches 0 and 100,Cloudiness and latitude appear uncorrelated
Global,Wind Speed,Windspeed and latitude are uncorrelated,Windspeed is typically less than 7.5 mph
Northern,Max Temperature,"Temperature and latitude are correlated, supported by r-squared of 0.74",Stronger correlation appears to exist when latitude < 40 degrees
Northern,Humidity,Correlation does not appear to exist between latitude and humidity,Humidty and latitude may have correlation when latitude > 50 degrees.  More analysis is needed.
Northern,Cloudiness,"Consistent with global observation, cloudiness and latitude are uncorrelated",Cloudiness distribution appears bi-modal supported by concentration of scatter plot points at extreme cloudiness values
Northern,Wind Speed,Windspeed and latitude are uncorrelated,"Consistent with global observation, most cities appear to have windspeed < 7.5 mph"
Southern,Max Temperature,"Unlike the northern hemisphere, there is no correlation between temperature and latitude",Temperature in the southern hemisphere lacks the extreme values observed in the north
Southern,Humidity,Humidity and latitude have low correlation,Humidity in the southern hemisphere rarely gets below 20%
Southern,Cloudiness,Cloudiness and latitude are uncorrelated,"Like in the northern hemisphere, cloudiness levels appear bi-modal although not as strongly."
Southern,Wind Speed,Windspeed and latitude are uncorrelated,Very few cities appear to have windspeeds less than 8 mph
